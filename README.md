#Chair Elimination

In looking for a new programming position I've been asked to solve some problems. Somre a quite boring while others turn out to be rather interesting. This one happened to be one of the more fun ones. The problem itself wasn't too interesting but figuring out the presentation was an interesting challange.

##The Problem
Take a second to imagine that you are in a room with 100 chairs arranged in a circle. These chairs are numbered sequentially from One to One Hundred. At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be told to leave the room. The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be told to leave. Next to go is person in chair #6. In other words, 1 person will be skipped initially, and then 2, 3, 4.. and so on. This pattern of skipping will keep going around the circle until there is only one person remaining- The survivor! Note that each chair is removed when the person leaves the room.

##The Solution
How to depict 100 chairs and the elimination process? The solution is written using Angular.js. It also gave me a chance to play with CSS animations and transforms. All in all, a fun exercise so I figured I'd share it here.


Enjoy!
